# backend-lab

## Overview
This repository is a **sandbox environment** for experimenting with backend concepts and understanding core server-side behaviors through small, focused experiments.

This is **not a production-ready project** and **not a showcase application**.


## Purpose
The main goals of this repository are:
- To explore backend concepts in isolation
- To understand edge cases and failure scenarios
- To build intuition around asynchronous behavior, error handling, and API design



## What This Repository Is
- A place to **experiment**
- A place to **break things intentionally**
- A place to **learn by observing real behavior**



## What This Repository Is NOT
- ❌ A polished backend product
- ❌ A full-stack application
- ❌ A tutorial copy-paste repository


## Experiments Structure
Each experiment lives in its own directory and contains:
- A clear objective
- A minimal implementation
- A short explanation of findings

Example structure:
```bash
experiments/
├─ async-await/
│ ├─ index.js
│ └─ README.md
└─ rate-limiting/
```


## Running Experiments
Each experiment can be run independently.

Basic setup:

```bash
  npm install
  node experiments/<experiment-name>/index.js
```

## Notes
This repository prioritizes **clarity of learning over code cleanliness.**

Some implementations are intentionally simple or incomplete.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT (Read This)

This repository exists to **support learning**, not to replace building real backend project
